This repository contains code for a weather forcast application built using the following web technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

The Installation process assumes that you already have the above technologies installed on your machine.

## Install

Navigate to the folder and run:

To start the server, you can run:

The server should start at port 3000 (default). Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the demo.

You can also use something like [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to watch your files and restart the server automatically!
